**INTRO**
-------------------------------------
 These articles are intended to guide a delevoper, analyst, or an individual investor with some programming experience on how to use Python and  Google Colab to get a financial data, analyse it, and test the investment hypothesis at scale
------------------------------------- 

The Colab code is used in the blog [PythonInvest](https://pythoninvest.com). Please refer to the Website or posts on Medium to get the most detailed explanation.

**COLAB NOTEBOOKS**
 
 All notebooks with the code are published in the colab_notebooks folder. Please copy them and try to run.
 I'm happy to hear any idea to improve the code or just that you find this work useful.

**STATIC**
 Some colab notebooks have dumps of graphs to the JSON format (Plotly), which is inserted to the website.
