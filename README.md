**INTRO**
-------------------------------------
 These articles are intended to guide a delevoper, analyst, or an individual investor with some programming experience on how to use Python and  Google Colab to get a financial data, analyse it, and test the investment hypothesis at scale
------------------------------------- 

The Colab code is used in the blog [PythonInvest](https://pythoninvest.com/blog). Please refer to the Website or posts on Medium to get the most detailed explanation.

**FOLDERS**

  **colab_notebooks**
   All notebooks with the code are published in the colab_notebooks folder. Please copy them and try to run.
   I'm happy to hear any idea to improve the code or just that you find this work useful.

  **static**
   Some colab notebooks have dumps of graphs to the JSON format (Plotly), which is inserted to the website.

  **news folder**
    That was a test daily run of one of the notebooks using Github Workflows (check .github/workflows/ for details)
  
  **yt_videos_colabs**
    Sometimes there is a redacted version (nomally, easier and smaller) of a main colab from an article, that I use in videos on the [PythonInvest YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg).
