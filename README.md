**COLAB NOTEBOOKS**
 
 All notebooks with the code are published in the colab_notebooks folder. Please copy them and try to run.
 I'm happy to hear any idea to improve the code or just that you find this work useful.

**STATIC**
 Some colab notebooks have dumps of graphs to the JSON format (Plotly), which is inserted to the website.
